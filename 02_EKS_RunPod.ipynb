    "We have already performed the Feature Engineering to create BERT embeddings from the `reviews_body` text using the pre-trained BERT model, and split the dataset into train, validation and test files. To optimize for Tensorflow training, we saved the files in TFRecord format. \n",

    "As mentioned earlier, BERT’s attention mechanism is called a Transformer. This is, not coincidentally, the name of the popular BERT Python library, “Transformers,” maintained by a company called [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). We will use a variant of BERT called [DistilBert](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01108.pdf) which requires less memory and compute, but maintains very good accuracy on our dataset."
